# Deep Thought

**Statement of Purpose:** Deep Thought is a mod for Minecraft that challenges a player’s ability to generate Redstone Flux 
(RF). When starting a Minecraft world or server the timer starts as soon as the first player joins and at spawn a 
`<block>` representing the server is spawned. It has a dynamic internal power storage that is continually drained by 
the <block’s> perpetual need for RF (to run the Minecraft world of course). Initially, the `<server block>` will 
start with `<default RF>` and will consume 0 RF/t. As time goes on the `<server block>` will demand more and more power. 
When the power runs out, you have failed at your one job...
